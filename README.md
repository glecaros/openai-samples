# Azure OpenAI Samples

This repository contains samples demonstrating how to use Azure OpenAI.

## Getting Started

To get started with these samples, you will need an Azure Account. To configure your environment you can either do it manually or use the included dev container definition.

If you chose to do it manually, you will need:

1. The Azure CLI installed on your machine.
2. The SDK for your language of choice.
3. If you want to run the notebooks, you will need to install the `bash_kernel` kernel.

## Samples

Each sample includes a `setup.ipynb` Jupyter notebook that guides you through the process of setting up the required resources.
